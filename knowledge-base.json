      "content": "Bankruptcy is a legal process designed to help individuals who can’t repay their debts. It gives you a fresh financial start by writing off most of your unsecured debts, but it also comes with serious consequences and restrictions.\n\n📝 How do you apply?\nIn the UK, you can apply for bankruptcy online through the government’s Insolvency Service. You don’t need to go to court unless someone else is making you bankrupt. It’s a big decision, so it’s important to get advice before applying.\n\n💷 How much does it cost?\nAs of now, it costs £680 to apply for bankruptcy. This fee must be paid before your application can be submitted, although payment plans may be available in some cases.\n\n👥 Who manages your bankruptcy?\nOnce your bankruptcy is approved, it is managed by an Official Receiver – a person who works for the Insolvency Service. They’ll review your finances and may take control of certain assets to help repay your debts. In some cases, a Trustee may also be appointed to handle this.\n\n⚠️ What restrictions does bankruptcy create?\nWhen you're bankrupt, there are several restrictions you must follow, including:\n\nYou can’t borrow more than £500 without telling the lender you’re bankrupt.\n\nYou can’t act as a company director without court permission.\n\nYou must cooperate fully with the Official Receiver and provide any information they request.\n\nYour credit file will show the bankruptcy for 6 years, which can make getting credit, renting, or even some jobs more difficult.\n\nYour assets may be sold, and you could be asked to make monthly payments for up to 3 years if you have disposable income.\n\n📌 Important: Bankruptcy can be life-changing, so it’s always best to speak to a free debt adviser before applying. They can help you explore all your options and make the best choice for your situation.",

Alterntively, the customer may make you aware directly.\n\nStop all contact and collection\nYou must stop chasing the customer for payment — no calls, emails, letters, or legal action. Bankruptcy protection means you're legally not allowed to pursue the debt.\n\nSend a Proof of Debt\nYou can submit a claim to the Official Receiver (or Trustee) showing how much you’re owed, with any evidence (like statements or contracts).\n\nWait for updates\nThe Receiver will deal with the customer’s assets. If there’s money left after priority debts and fees, you might get a small payment (called a dividend), though this is rare.\n\nDebt is written off\nAfter 12 months, bankruptcy usually ends. Most unsecured debts (like loans or credit cards) are written off. You can’t chase the customer after this.",

Current debt limit: £30,000 (England & Wales).\n\nEligibility Criteria:\n\nTotal qualifying debts ≤ £30,000\n\nLimited assets (generally no more than £2,000, excluding certain essential items)\n\nLow disposable income (typically less than £75 per month after essential outgoings)\n\nMust not have had a DRO in the past six years\n\nDuration: Standard DRO period is 12 months. If circumstances remain unchanged, qualifying debts are written off at the end of this period.\n\nCredit Impact: DROs remain on the individual’s credit file for six years, affecting future credit applications.\n\nApplication Process:\n\nMust be completed through an approved intermediary (debt adviser from an approved organisation).\n\nA one-off fee of £90 is payable before submission.\n\nEffect During DRO: Creditors included in the DRO cannot pursue repayment while the order is active.\n\nConsiderations for Staff:\n\nDROs are suitable only for those meeting strict eligibility criteria; staff should verify circumstances carefully.\n\nWhile DROs provide debt relief, they have long-term implications for the customer’s credit rating and financial options.\n\nStaff should advise customers of alternative solutions if DROs are not appropriate.",

      "content": "What is APR?\nAPR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It represents the total cost of borrowing over a year, including interest and any compulsory fees, expressed as an annual percentage of the amount borrowed.\n\nWhy Do We Use It?\nAlthough our products are short-term and interest is typically calculated on a daily basis, we are still required by regulation to display an APR. This ensures transparency and consistency across all lenders, allowing customers to compare the cost of credit between different products and providers — even if the borrowing period is much shorter than a year.\n\nHow It Relates to High-Cost Short-Term Credit (HCSTC):\n\nIn high-cost short-term lending, the APR appears very high because it’s an annualised figure based on daily interest rates applied to short borrowing periods.\n\nFor example, a loan that runs for 30 days with daily interest may look disproportionately high when shown as an annual rate, but this doesn’t mean the borrower is paying that amount — it’s simply how the cost is standardised for comparison.\n\nThe key figure for our customers remains the total amount repayable and the daily interest rate, which reflect the true short-term cost of borrowing.\n\nIn Summary:\nWe calculate interest daily to reflect short borrowing terms, but we must display the APR to comply with consumer credit regulations and maintain transparency for customers.",

Existing Customers with an Account\n\nIf the customer already has an account with us, the exact APR and full loan details are available within their Consumer Credit Agreement.\n\nThis document can be found in the customer’s account area under “Attachments.”\nYou should guide the customer to this section and explain that the agreement outlines their specific loan terms, including:\n\nThe interest rate\n\nThe total charge for credit\n\nThe total amount repayable\n\nThe representative APR",

It gives a clear, concise breakdown of how much the customer has borrowed and how much they have paid in charges (interest and fees) over a reporting period.\n\nPurpose:\n\nShow the total amount borrowed during the reporting period.\n\nShow the total charges (interest, fees, and other costs).\n\nImprove transparency so customers can see the true cost of repeat or short-term borrowing.\n\nHelp customers make informed decisions about future borrowing and seek debt advice if needed.\n\nKey points:\n\nThe SOB is informational only — it is not a collection notice or enforcement action.\n\nIt is a regulatory requirement designed to protect consumers and ensure visibility of repeated HCST borrowing.\n\nWhen a customer SHOULD be sent an SOB\n\nA lender must send a Summary of Borrowing:\n\nEvery three months (quarterly), in arrears, covering the previous three-month period — regardless of whether payments are due or the account is active, where the customer has had HCST borrowing that meets the FCA reporting criteria.\n\nWhen the account is closed (including where the debt is sold or transferred to another creditor/third party).\n\nWhere there has been repeat borrowing from the lender (i.e., the customer has borrowed more than once), or otherwise where the FCA’s HCST reporting criteria apply.\n",

      "content": "1. Introduction\n\nIntroduce yourself and the company.\n\nComplete DPA/security checks.\n\nAdvise the customer that calls are recorded (outbound calls).\n\n2. Middle of the Call (Information Gathering)\n\nUse open questions to understand the customer’s situation:\n\n“How can I help you today?”\n\n“What has caused you to miss payments?”\n\n“Has anything changed in your circumstances recently?”\n\n“Is your situation likely to change in the near future?”\n\n“What steps are you taking to improve your situation?”\n\nKeep the conversation focused, supportive, and non-judgmental.\n\n3. Resolution\n\nExplore what the customer’s situation allows them to do:\n\nDo they need time to assess their finances or seek advice?\n\nIf they have income, how much can they reasonably pay toward their debt?\n\nCan the customer make a realistic offer?\n\nIf not, consider completing an Income & Expenditure (I&E) with them.\n\nCan they make a token payment during the call as a sign of goodwill?\n\nYour aim is to reach a fair and sustainable solution based on their circumstances.\n\n4. Call Closure\n\nBefore ending the call, confirm the following clearly:\n\nThe resolution/solution agreed\n\nThe terms (amounts, dates, frequency)\n\nWhether an email will be sent confirming the arrangement\n\nThe consequences of not maintaining the arrangement, such as:\n\nIssuing a pending default notice to credit reference agencies\n\nInstructing a third-party debt recovery agency\n\nCancelling the arrangement and returning the account to collections\n\nSet clear expectations:\n\nWho will contact them\n\nWhen they will be contacted\n\nHow we will communicate about upcoming payments or failed payments\n\nAlways close by asking:\n“Is there anything else I can help you with today?”",

      "title": "What are the consequences of non-payment?",
      "content": "1. Arrangement Cancelled\n\nIf the customer misses a payment or breaks the terms of the plan:\n\nThe current payment arrangement will be cancelled.\n\nThe account will return to active collections, meaning further contact attempts may be made to resolve the arrears.\n\nYou should always tell the customer:\n\n“If the agreed payment is not made, the arrangement may be cancelled and your account will return to collections for further action.”\n\n\n2. Pending Default Notice Issued\n\nIf the account continues to remain unpaid:\n\nA Pending Default Notice may be issued.\n\nThis is a formal warning that a default could be recorded if no action is taken.\n\nIt gives the customer an opportunity to bring the account back in line before a default is applied.\n\nThis should be explained clearly:\n\n“If the arrears are not resolved, we may issue a Pending Default Notice which is a formal step before a default is registered with credit reference agencies.”\n\n\n3. Default Registered with Credit Reference Agencies\n\nIf the customer still fails to contact us or make payments:\n\nA default may be registered on their credit file.\n\nThis will remain on their credit report for six years.\n\nIt can affect their ability to obtain credit, mortgages, phone contracts, or other financial services.\n\nExplain simply:\n\n“A default can impact your credit rating for six years and may affect future borrowing.”\n\n\n4. Third-Party Debt Recovery Agency Instructed\n\nIf the account cannot be resolved directly:\n\nThe debt may be transferred to a licensed third-party debt recovery agency.\n\nThe customer will then be contacted by the agency, not us.\n\nThe agency may use their own contact processes to recover the balance.\n\nExplain clearly and calmly:\n\n“If the account remains unpaid, it may be passed to a third-party debt recovery agency who will continue recovery efforts.”\n\n\n5. Additional Collections Activity\n\nDepending on the customer’s behaviour and account history, further action may include:\n\nIncreased outbound contact to try to engage the customer\n\nWritten correspondence outlining the arrears and next steps\n\nReassessment of the customer’s affordability if they re-engage\n\nThese actions should always be proportionate, fair, and compliant with regulatory requirements.\n\n\n6. Potential Legal Action (if applicable to your business)\n\nIf your organisation uses legal recovery routes, consequences may also include:\n\nEscalation to the legal team for pre-legal assessment\n\nThe possibility of a County Court Judgment (CCJ)\n\nFurther enforcement if a CCJ remains unpaid\n\nOnly include this section if legal routes are used. If not, I can remove or adapt it.\n\n\n7. Impact on Future Lending\n\nIf the customer continues to default or shows poor repayment behaviour:\n\nThey may be restricted from future borrowing\n\nTheir account may be flagged internally\n\nThey may be declined for new applications until the debt is resolved\n\nExplain in simple terms:\n\n“Non-payment can affect future lending decisions with us.”\n\nSummary to Read to Customers\n\nHere’s a simplified version for agents to use during calls:\n\n“If the payment isn’t made, the arrangement may be cancelled and your account will return to collections.\nIf it remains unpaid, we may issue a Pending Default Notice which can lead to a default being registered on your credit file for six years.\nThe account may also be passed to a third-party debt recovery agency.\nIt’s really important we work together to agree a plan that is realistic and sustainable for you.”",

Identity Verification\n\nBefore data can be released, identity must be verified.\nFollow our standard security checks.\nIf identity can't be safely confirmed, the timeframe is paused until verification is completed.\n\n4. What Happens After the Task Is Raised\n\nHandled by Alex Cross:\n\nLogging the DSAR\n\nGathering all relevant data (notes, correspondence, call recordings, documents)\n\nReviewing and redacting where needed\n\nPreparing the DSAR response pack\n\nSending securely to the customer\n\nClosing the complaint task\n\nRecording completion in the SAR log\n\nAgents do not prepare, review, or send DSAR information themselves.\n\n5. What to Avoid\n\nNever refuse a request because it’s verbal\n\nNever send personal data directly\n\nNever promise specific data points (e.g., “we definitely have that call recording”)\n\nNever delay raising the task — the one-month timeframe starts immediately upon receipt\n\n6. Standard Script Example (Optional for Agents)\n\n“I can help with that. I’ll log a Subject Access Request for you today. We must respond within one month, and if the request is complex we may extend by up to two additional months — but we would let you know within the first month if that’s needed.”",
