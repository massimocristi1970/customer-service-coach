The \npurpose is to ensure that complaints are handled promptly, fairly, and impartially, and that customers are kept \ninformed throughout the process. \nOur objective is to resolve customer complaints efficiently and, where possible, prevent them from escalating \nto the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). \n \nFCA Regulations and Principles \nSLPL follows the FCA Principles for Businesses, specifically focusing on Principle 6 (Treating Customers \nFairly) and Principle 7 (Clear, Fair, and Not Misleading Communications). SLPL is also bound by the FCA \nConsumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), which outlines detailed obligations for credit-related activities, and \nDISP, which governs complaint handling. \nKey FCA Principles: \n• Principle 6: Firms must pay due regard to the interests of their customers and treat them fairly. \n• Principle 7: Firms must communicate information to their clients in a way that is clear, fair, and not \nmisleading. \n \nWhat is a Complaint? \nA complaint is defined as any oral or written expression of dissatisfaction, whether justified or not, from a \ncustomer or a representative, about SLPL’s provision of, or failure to provide, a financial service. The complaint \nmay allege that the complainant has suffered (or may suffer) financial loss, material distress, or material \ninconvenience. \nComplaints can be received directly from customers, third parties such as claims management companies, or \nother entities acting on behalf of customers. \n \nComplaints Handling Process \n1. Informal Complaints \nWhen a complaint is received: \n• The staff member who receives the complaint will attempt to resolve it within 3 business days \nfollowing the day of receipt. \n\n4 | P  a  g  e  Complaints Handling  Policy \n• If resolved, a Summary Resolution Communication will be sent to the complainant, confirming that \nthe complaint has been resolved and informing them of their right to refer the complaint to the \nFinancial Ombudsman Service (FOS) if they are not satisfied. \n2. Formal Complaints \nIf the complaint is not resolved within 3 business days, it will be escalated to the formal complaints process: \n• Acknowledgement of the complaint will be sent within 5 business days of receipt, including the details \nof the person handling the complaint. \n• The complaint will be investigated thoroughly, including gathering all relevant documents, records, and \nevidence. \n• The complainant will be kept informed throughout the investigation, with an update provided at 4 \nweeks if the complaint is still being investigated. \n3. Final Response \nWithin 8 weeks, SLPL will issue a Final Response Letter. This will: \n• Accept the complaint and, where appropriate, offer redress. \n• Offer redress without accepting the complaint. \n• Reject the complaint and provide clear reasons for doing so. \nIf the complaint is not resolved within 8 weeks, SLPL will provide an explanation for the delay and inform the \ncomplainant of their right to refer the complaint to the FOS. \n4. Right to Refer to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) \nIf the complainant is dissatisfied with the final response, or if SLPL has not provided a final response within 8 \nweeks, they can refer the complaint to the FOS. The Final Response Letter will include the FOS leaflet and \ncontact information. \n \nComplaint Categories \nSLPL categorises complaints into four broad areas for monitoring and reporting purposes: \n1. Advising, Selling, and Arranging: Includes issues such as unsuitable advice, misleading advertising, or \nselling a product that was not requested or is unsuitable. \n2. Terms and Disputed Sums/Charges: Includes overcharging, breach of contract, or disputes over \nsums payable. \n3. General Administration/Customer Service: Includes delays, poor customer service, failure to carry \nout instructions, or rude staff. \n4. Arrears Management: Includes complaints related to arrears, such as aggressive debt collection \npractices or failure to agree on a repayment plan. \n \nMonitoring and Root Cause Analysis \nSLPL conducts regular Root Cause Analysis on complaints to: \n• Identify trends and recurring issues. \n\n5 | P  a  g  e  Complaints Handling  Policy \n• Understand the underlying reasons for complaints. \n• Address and resolve any systemic issues within the company’s processes. \nSenior management reviews complaint data quarterly to ensure continuous improvement and to implement any \nnecessary corrective actions. \n \nTraining and Competence \nAll staff involved in handling complaints receive comprehensive training on: \n• DISP requirements and FCA expectations. \n• How to identify and record complaints. \n• Customer communication, including handling complaints professionally and empathetically. \n• SLPL’s internal procedures for escalating and resolving complaints. \nStaff training is updated annually to reflect changes in regulation and company processes. \n \nRecords and Reporting \nRecord Keeping \nSLPL retains records of all complaints for a minimum of six years. These records include: \n• The name of the complainant. \n• A summary of the complaint and outcome. \n• Any correspondence between the complainant and SLPL. \n• Records of any redress or compensation offered. \nRegulatory Reporting \nSLPL is committed to complying with all regulatory reporting obligations under DISP 1.10. This includes \nproviding accurate and timely data to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regarding the volume, nature, and \nresolution of complaints. The reporting process ensures transparency and allows the FCA to monitor SLPL’s \nadherence to complaint-handling rules and identify any trends that may require regulatory intervention. \nFCA Complaints Return \nSLPL submits a Complaints Return to the FCA bi-annually, detailing: \n• Total number of complaints received: This includes all complaints, whether resolved informally within \n3 business days or escalated to the formal process. \n• Nature of the complaints: SLPL categorises complaints into relevant types, such as financial advice, \nproduct suitability, customer service, or issues relating to arrears and collections. \n• Complaint outcomes: SLPL reports on the resolution status of each complaint, specifying the number \nof complaints upheld, partially upheld, or rejected. \n• Complaints resolved within 8 weeks: SLPL is required to report on the timeliness of its complaint \nresolutions, indicating the percentage of complaints closed within the FCA's 8-week deadline. \n\n6 | P  a  g  e  Complaints Handling  Policy \n• Redress offered: SLPL reports on the total amount of redress or compensation provided to \ncomplainants, as well as any corrective actions taken to address systemic issues uncovered by the \ncomplaints process. \nAccuracy and Compliance \nSLPL ensures that all data submitted to the FCA is accurate and complete. The Compliance Team reviews the \ncomplaints data before submission to ensure it meets FCA standards, and any discrepancies or areas of \nconcern are investigated and rectified. \nSenior Management Oversight \nThe Senior Management Team (SMT) reviews the Complaints Return before submission to the FCA to ensure \nfull regulatory compliance and that any emerging risks or trends are identified and addressed. The data from the \nComplaints Return is also used internally to improve processes and enhance the overall customer experience. \n \nEscalation to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) \nCustomers may refer their complaint to the FOS if they are dissatisfied with SLPL’s final response or if SLPL fails \nto provide a final response within the FCA’s 8-week deadline. The FOS is free to consumers, and SLPL will \ncooperate fully with any FOS investigation. \n \nOnline Dispute Resolution (ODR) \nFor complaints arising from online transactions, SLPL complies with the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) \nplatform. Customers who wish to submit complaints via this platform will be informed that the complaint will \nbe passed to the FOS for review if necessary. \n \nContinuous Improvement and Policy Review \nThis policy is reviewed bi-annually by the senior management team to ensure it remains current and effective. \nUpdates to the policy are communicated to all staff, and changes are documented as part of the company’s \ngovernance and control framework. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 | P  a  g  e  Complaints Handling  Policy \nAppendix A - Customer Information \nIf you are not satisfied with any aspect of the service you have received from Savvy Loan \nProduct Limited (SLPL), we would like you to tell us your concerns. \nYou can contact us by e-mail, post, fax, in person or by telephone. \nUpon receipt of your complaint, we will do our best to resolve your complaint by the end of the \nnext business day. \nIf we cannot do this, we will send you an acknowledgement of your complaint within 5 working \ndays and let you know who is dealing with it. \nWe will issue a final response letter within eight weeks of receiving your complaint. \nIf you are dissatisfied with our final response, or we have not provided a final response within \neight weeks of receiving your complaint you have a number of options available to you.  \nYou can ask us for a review, or you can ask our trade association to review your complaint and \nthe way we have handled it.

Our procedures prioritise treating customers fairly, particularly \nthose facing genuine financial difficulties, and are designed to avoid unnecessary escalation to debt collection. \nThis policy is formulated in line with FCA CONC 7 (Arrears, Default, and Recovery) and incorporates best practices \nfrom the Money Advice Liaison Group (MALG) guidelines and the FCA's guidance on consumer vulnerability. \n \nTreating Customers Fairly (TCF) \nSLPL adheres to the FCA's Principle 6, which requires firms to treat customers fairly. We ensure that: \n• No undue pressure is placed on customers to repay debts. \n• Communication is clear, accurate, and not misleading. \n• We  respect  customers'  circumstances,  particularly  those  experiencing  financial  difficulty,  by \nexercising forbearance and offering flexible solutions. \n• Vulnerable  customers  are  treated  with  particular  care,  and  staff  are  trained  to  recognise  and \nrespond to signs of vulnerability. \n \nCommunication with Customers \nWhen  a  payment  is  missed,  we  proactively  contact customers  to  understand  the  reason  for  non-payment  and \nexplore repayment options. Contact methods include telephone, email, and SMS, with communications that: \n• Avoid using premium-rate numbers. \n• Respect the customer's privacy and avoid embarrassment. \n• Are clear, concise, and respectful, ensuring customers understand their obligations and available \noptions. \n• Offer flexible repayment arrangements based on the customer's financial situation. \nIf the customer remains unresponsive, we continue attempting contact for up to 90 days before referring the account \nto an FCA-authorised third-party debt collection agency. \n \nForbearance and Vulnerable Customers \nWe  recognise  that  financial  difficulties  may  arise  due  to  various  factors,  including  personal  hardship,  job  loss,  or \nillness. SLPL offers forbearance in the form of: \n• Breathing Space: A 30-day pause on collection activities while customers develop a repayment \nplan. This period can be extended based on the customer’s circumstances. \n• Repayment Plans: We negotiate affordable repayment plans based on income and expenditure \nassessments, using the Standard Financial Statement as a guideline. \n• Interest and  Charge  Freezing: Interest  and  charges  are  frozen  when a  customer agrees  to  and \nmaintains a repayment plan. \n• Mental  Health  Support: For  customers  with  mental  health  challenges,  we  follow  the Money \nAdvice  Liaison  Group  (MALG)  guidelines and  provide  them  with  the Debt  and  Mental  Health \nEvidence Form to allow their health care provider to submit relevant information. \n \nCriteria for Specific Forbearance Actions \nTo  align  with  updated  FCA  CONC  requirements,  SLPL  has  established  clear  criteria  for  the  application of  specific \nforbearance measures, including debt transfer and extended repayment options. This ensures that all actions taken \nare appropriate to the customer’s circumstances and align with fair treatment principles outlined in CONC 7.3.4 and \nCONC 7.3.5. \n \nKey forbearance measures and their criteria include: \n \n• Debt  Transfer  to  Third-party  Collection:  Initiated  only  after  all  internal  options  for  repayment \nflexibility are exhausted and no engagement has been received from the customer within 60 days. \n\n4 | Page   Debt Management Policy \nThis action is communicated clearly to the customer, with guidance on independent debt advice \nwhere needed. \n• Extended  Repayment  Terms: Offered  when  standard  repayment  options  may  impose  undue \nhardship. Eligibility is based on a thorough review of the customer’s income and expenditure, with \nterms designed to reflect sustainable repayment amounts. \n \n• Temporary   Payment   Reductions: Offer   a   short-term   reduction   in   monthly   payments   for \ncustomers experiencing temporary financial setbacks. This allows them to keep up with reduced \npayments  without  defaulting  on  the  loan,  and  payments  can  gradually  return  to  the  standard \namount as their financial situation stabilises. \n \n• Interest  Rate  Reduction: Reduce  or  suspend  interest  on  outstanding  balances  for  a  specified \nperiod, particularly if the customer’s financial hardship would make it difficult to meet interest \npayments. This helps prevent the debt from increasing due to accrued interest. \n \n• Deferment Period: Allow a customer to defer payments temporarily, typically for 1-3 months, if \nthey’re undergoing a financial crisis, like job loss or major medical expenses. This period gives \nthem time to reorganise their finances and return to the standard payment schedule. \n \n• Pro-Rata Repayment Plan: Develop a plan where the repayment amount is proportionate to the \ncustomer’s current disposable income. This measure is particularly useful if customers have \nmultiple debts, as it aligns with the amount they can reasonably afford to repay without additional \nfinancial strain. \n \n• Payment Holiday: Provide a payment holiday for up to three months in cases of extreme financial \ndistress,  such  as  major  health  issues  or  bereavement.  This  helps  customers  avoid  missed \npayments and late fees while managing personal challenges. \n \n• Debt  Restructuring: Offer  to  restructure  the  debt  by  extending  the  repayment  period,  lowering \nmonthly  payment  amounts.  This  can  make  payments  more  manageable  over  a  longer  period, \neasing the immediate burden on the customer. \n \n• Waiving Fees and Penalties: In certain situations, waiving late fees, penalty charges, or default \ncharges can help customers manage their debt without feeling overwhelmed by additional costs, \nparticularly if they’re already in financial distress. \n \n• Enhanced  Financial  Support:  For  customers  who  require  additional  guidance,  direct  them  to \nindependent,  FCA-authorised  debt  advice  services  for  ongoing  financial  support  and  advice  on \nmanaging their financial situation. \n \n \nThis  structured  approach  ensures  forbearance  measures  are  applied  consistently,  helping  SLPL  uphold  fair \ntreatment standards while addressing each customer’s specific financial circumstances. \n \n \nPeriodic Review of Forbearance Practices \n \nIn accordance with the latest FCA CONC guidance, SLPL is committed to not only offering a range of forbearance \noptions  but  also  to  systematically  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  these  options  in  delivering  positive  customer \noutcomes. \nTo  ensure  comprehensive  support  and  alignment  with  FCA  expectations,  SLPL  will  introduce  regular,  periodic \nreviews  of  forbearance  outcomes.  These  reviews  will  assess  the  collective  impact  of  our  forbearance  measures, \nensuring  they  remain  consistent  with  fair  treatment  principles  and  contribute  to  holistic,  positive  results  for \ncustomers experiencing financial distress. \n\n5 | Page   Debt Management Policy \nThis  approach  will  enable  SLPL  to  make  any  necessary  adjustments  to  our  practices,  ensuring  a  balanced  and \nsupportive debt management process that upholds the highest standards of customer care. \nVulnerable Customers \nVulnerable  customers  are  identified  and  treated  with  care  and  consideration.  Our  staff  receive  comprehensive \ntraining  to  recognise  vulnerability,  and  SLPL  follows  a  dedicated Vulnerable  Customer  Policy.  Vulnerability  can \narise from various circumstances, including but not limited to: \n• Mental health conditions. \n• Financial hardship. \n• Personal circumstances, such as bereavement. \nWe  provide  tailored  solutions  for  these  customers,  offering  flexible  repayment  options  and  signposting  them  to \nindependent debt advice services. \n \nRepayment Offers \nSLPL  ensures  that  repayment  negotiations  are  conducted  fairly  and  that  customers  are  not  pressured  into \nunsustainable repayment plans. We offer the following repayment options: \n• Immediate Payment: Customers can make payments via debit card, electronic transfer, or online \nportals. \n• Promise to Pay: Customers can agree to clear arrears on a future date, which is documented and \nfollowed up if missed. \n• Repayment    Plans: Structured    repayment    plans    based    on    the    customer's    financial \ncircumstances, which are reviewed every six months to ensure sustainability. \nWe ensure that customers are not coerced into selling assets, borrowing, or increasing debt to meet repayments. \n \nContinuous Payment Authority (CPA) \nSLPL uses CPA to collect repayments as agreed with the customer. Key CPA practices include: \n• Sending a payment reminder at least three days before the due date. \n• Attempting  payment  collection  only twice,  and  ceasing  further  attempts  if  they  fail,  unless \nexplicitly agreed upon with the customer. \n• Allowing  customers  to  cancel  or  amend  the  CPA  arrangement  at  any  time,  ensuring  clear \ncommunication about the process. \nIf  the  customer  fails  to  make  payments,  we  offer  grace  periods  and  encourage  them  to  engage  with  us  to  avoid \nadditional fees or negative credit reporting. \n \nThird-party Debt Collection and Transfer of Debt \nSLPL only transfers debt recovery responsibility to FCA-authorised debt collection agencies after 90 days of non-\npayment and no customer response. We ensure: \n• Clear communication with customers when their debt is transferred. \n• Cooperation with debt management companies or third-party representatives if customers seek \nindependent debt advice. \nWe do not sell debts to third-party purchasers and ensure that all data passed to external agencies is accurate and \ntransferred securely. \n \nCharges and Interest \nCustomers  may  be  charged  default  interest  or  fees,  but  these  are  capped  in  compliance  with FCA  price  cap \nregulations. All charges and interest terms are transparently communicated to customers at the start of the loan \nand before any arrears charges are applied. \n \nNegotiated Settlements and Disputed Debts \nCustomers are entitled to settle their loan early or make partial repayments. SLPL ensures that: \n\n6 | Page   Debt Management Policy \n• Early settlement offers are calculated fairly, with interest rebates applied as appropriate. \n• Disputed  debts  are  paused  while  we  investigate  and  provide  the  customer  with   evidence \nsubstantiating the debt. \n• Customers   are   given   access   to   alternative   dispute   resolution   mechanisms,   including   the \nFinancial  Ombudsman  Service  (FOS),  if  they  remain  unsatisfied  with  the  outcome  of  a  debt \ndispute. \n \nDebt Write-off and Statute Barred Debt \nSLPL considers debt write-off in specific circumstances, such as: \n• Deceased Customers: Upon receiving a death certificate, all collection activities cease. \n• Vulnerability: In cases of severe vulnerability, SLPL may write off the debt if recovery is deemed \ninappropriate. \n• Statute Barred Debt: If a debt is not acknowledged for six years, and we have not pursued it, SLPL \nwill not attempt further collection. \n \nRecord Keeping and Reporting \nSLPL  complies  with SYSC  9.1.1R by  maintaining  comprehensive  records  of  all  arrears  management  and  debt \ncollection activities. This includes: \n• Payment requests and refusals under CPA. \n• Customer repayment histories and arrangements. \n• Disputes and resolutions. \n \nStaff Training and Quality Assurance \nAll  staff  receive  thorough  training  on  arrears  management,  forbearance,  and  vulnerable  customer  handling.  SLPL \noperates a Quality Assurance (QA) programme, which involves: \n• Monthly monitoring of staff interactions, including live and recorded call reviews. \n• 1:1 coaching for staff where exceptions are identified. \n• Regular  compliance  reviews  of  post-contractual  notices  and  repayment  agreements  to  ensure \nbest practices are followed.",

Introduction \nThe Responsible Lending Policy at Savvy Loan Products Limited (SLPL) outlines our commitment to \nresponsible lending practices that meet or exceed regulatory standards. This policy establishes \nprotocols for assessing customer affordability, managing credit risk, and ensuring that SLPL products are \naccessible to consumers who can realistically manage repayment obligations. \nOur Responsible Lending Policy reflects the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidelines and the \nConsumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), designed to protect consumer interests, particularly for those \nwho may be vulnerable or new to high-cost credit products. It serves as a guide for all staff involved in \nlending decisions and customer interactions, and it reinforces our corporate values, commitment to \ntransparency, and the ethical standards expected in all consumer engagements. \n2. Regulation and Legal Compliance \nAs an FCA-regulated entity, SLPL complies with the FCA's Principles for Businesses and specific \nregulations in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). Key areas of focus include: \n• Principle 6: Treating customers fairly, embedding fairness at every stage of the lending cycle, \nincluding decision-making, product suitability, and post-lending support. \n• Principle 7: Ensuring clear, fair, and not misleading communication with customers, aligning all \ninformation, promotional materials, and disclosures with the CONC requirements. \n• Principle 8: Managing conflicts of interest fairly and transparently. \n• Principle 11: Dealing with regulators in an open and cooperative manner, promptly disclosing \nrelevant information. \nWe adhere to the CONC Handbook's requirements in responsible lending, including CONC 5 \n(affordability assessments) and CONC 7 (collections and forbearance), as well as other applicable \nguidance documents. SLPL’s compliance team conducts regular reviews to ensure all lending processes \nalign with the evolving FCA requirements. \n3. Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) \nSLPL embeds the FCA’s Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) principles across its business to ensure fair \nand appropriate treatment of all customers. SLPL's TCF initiatives aim to: \n1. Foster confidence that SLPL values fair treatment as central to its corporate culture. \n2. Design and target products that meet the identified needs of our customer base, including those \nseeking high-cost, short-term credit. \n3. Provide clear, transparent information throughout the customer journey, including pre-\ncontractual, contractual, and post-contractual stages. \n4. Ensure advice, where provided, is tailored to individual customer circumstances, avoiding \nproduct recommendations that may lead to financial harm. \n5. Deliver products that meet customer expectations as promised. \n6. Minimize unreasonable barriers in complaint handling, product switching, or submitting claims. \nRegular training ensures that SLPL’s staff understand and implement TCF principles, contributing to an \nethical and supportive approach in all consumer interactions. \n\n4 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n4. FCA Consumer Duty and Customer Outcomes \nThe Consumer Duty principles guide SLPL’s commitment to consumer well-being by focusing on \nproduct suitability, transparent communication, and fair outcomes. This section outlines SLPL’s \nadherence to the FCA’s four pillars: \n• Product and Service Design: All products are designed with our customers’ needs and \naffordability in mind. SLPL performs periodic reviews of its product portfolio to ensure continued \nrelevance and fairness. \n• Fair Pricing and Avoiding Consumer Detriment: SLPL’s pricing model is transparent, adhering \nto the FCA's Cost Cap for High-Cost Short-Term Credit, and is regularly reviewed to prevent \nconsumer detriment. \n• Customer Understanding and Engagement: We provide accessible, timely information on our \nwebsite and during the application process, ensuring customers make informed decisions. \n• Effective Complaint Handling: SLPL is committed to learning from customer complaints. \nComplaint data is analysed to identify trends, enabling us to improve product offerings and \ncustomer service. \n5. Underwriting and Credit Risk Assessment \nSLPL’s underwriting process includes thorough credit risk assessments to protect both the customer \nand the company. Key components include: \n• Identity Verification: Customer identity is verified using industry-standard checks, such as \nelectronic verification and reference checks. \n• Income Validation: Income sources are verified through multiple channels, ensuring that the \nincome declared by the customer aligns with independent third-party data. \n• Credit Commitments and Expenditure: Customer expenditure and existing credit obligations \nare assessed to ensure that the loan can be repaid without compromising other financial \nobligations. \n• Decision Engine and Manual Underwriting: SLPL’s automated Decision Engine assesses the \naffordability of each application. Where additional clarification is needed, an underwriter \nconducts a detailed review before finalizing the decision. \n6. Affordability and Creditworthiness \nThe Affordability and Creditworthiness Policy (see Appendix A) is central to SLPL’s responsible lending \napproach. Key elements include: \n• Calculation of Disposable Income: SLPL assesses disposable income based on a \ncomprehensive analysis of income, expenses, and existing credit obligations. \n• Income Buffer: To protect against unforeseen expenses, SLPL applies an income buffer, \nallowing room for unexpected life events, such as medical expenses or income loss. \n• Affordability Assessments: Each application undergoes a structured affordability assessment, \nconsidering essential living costs, housing expenses, and other monthly obligations, ensuring \nthe loan does not pose an undue financial burden. \n7. Vulnerable Customer Considerations \nSLPL recognizes the importance of identifying and assisting vulnerable customers. We use the FCA’s \nguidance to support customers experiencing challenges, which may impact their ability to manage credit \neffectively. The TEXAS (Tell, Explain, Ask, Signpost) and IDEA (Impact, Duration, Experiences, and \n\n5 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \nAssistance) frameworks are applied to ensure our team recognizes and supports vulnerable customers \nappropriately. SLPL provides additional support through tailored product terms, flexible repayment \noptions, and specialized assistance, ensuring fair outcomes for vulnerable individuals. \n8. Staff Training and Accountability \nSLPL’s training program is structured to ensure that staff understand and apply responsible lending \npractices, TCF principles, and FCA Consumer Duty requirements. Key components include: \n• Onboarding and Ongoing Training: Staff undergo comprehensive training on responsible \nlending, with periodic refreshers to address regulatory updates and emerging industry practices. \n• Performance Reviews: Staff performance is reviewed against compliance with responsible \nlending standards, and additional training is provided as needed. \n• Senior Management Accountability: SLPL’s senior management team oversees compliance \nand is responsible for embedding the Consumer Duty principles in all aspects of the business. \n9. Arrears and Debt Management \nFor customers experiencing financial difficulty, SLPL applies forbearance and constructive debt \nmanagement practices. We commit to: \n• Offering tailored repayment plans. \n• Freezing interest on arrears when feasible. \n• Providing access to debt management support and external advisory services. \nOur debt management practices are aligned with CONC 7, and we communicate proactively with \ncustomers in arrears to help them navigate financial difficulties without undue stress. \n10. Repeat Borrowing \nSLPL limits the potential for dependency on short-term credit by restricting repeat borrowing. A customer \nmay access a maximum of three loans, and each loan application undergoes a rigorous affordability and \ncreditworthiness check. We implement cooling-off periods between loans to discourage reliance on \nshort-term credit, ensuring that repeat borrowing does not lead to long-term financial harm. \n11. Pre-Contractual and Post-Contractual Obligations \nSLPL ensures all pre-contractual obligations are met, providing customers with transparent information \nabout loan terms, costs, and repayment obligations. Pre-Contract Information (PCI) is provided in \naccordance with CONC 4 to ensure that customers can make informed choices before entering into \ncredit agreements. \nPost-contract, SLPL provides account statements, payment reminders, and periodic updates, enabling \ncustomers to manage their loans effectively. We adhere to the Consumer Credit Act 1974, ensuring \ncustomers receive timely information about their repayment schedules, any changes to loan terms, and \nhow to seek assistance if they encounter difficulties. \n12. Communications and Adequate Explanations \nSLPL prioritizes clear communication to ensure customers understand their rights, obligations, and the \nterms of their loans. Each customer receives an adequate explanation of the loan’s features, repayment \nstructures, and potential consequences of non-payment, as outlined in CONC 4.2. Staff are trained to \nanswer any customer questions, and our website offers detailed FAQs to support informed decision-\nmaking. \n\n6 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n13. Forbearance and Financial Distress \nWhen customers experience financial distress, SLPL takes a supportive and flexible approach, offering \nassistance through: \n• Flexible Repayment Options: Options include rescheduled payments and adjusted repayment \nterms based on individual circumstances. \n• Interest Freezing: We may freeze interest on outstanding amounts to prevent debt escalation. \n• Signposting to Support Services: SLPL provides information on free, independent debt \ncounselling and advisory services. \n14. Monitoring and Compliance \nSLPL employs a comprehensive monitoring and compliance program that includes regular audits, \ncompliance checks, and quality assurance reviews. This three-tiered monitoring system involves: \n• First Line: Daily compliance checks by team leads. \n• Second Line: Compliance audits conducted monthly. \n• Third Line: External audits on a bi-annual basis. \nThe Affordability and Creditworthiness Policy (Appendix A) is reviewed annually, and SLPL maintains \nup-to-date training records to ensure adherence to FCA standards. \n15. Conclusion \nSLPL remains committed to responsible lending practices that ensure customer welfare, minimize \nfinancial harm, and meet the highest industry standards. This policy will be reviewed and updated \nperiodically to reflect changes in FCA regulations, industry best practices, and consumer needs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n16. Appendix A: Affordability and Creditworthiness Policy \nScope of Policy \nThis policy sets out the procedures which must be followed to enable Savvy Loan Products Limited \n(“SLPL”) to comply with its regulatory obligations. It applies to all employees and consultants (“staff”) of \nSLPL and aims to maintain the high standards of conduct which currently exist within the company by \nensuring that loans are affordable based upon an analysis of the information that is available at the time \nthe loan is made.   \nFailure by a member of staff to comply with the procedures set out in this policy may lead to disciplinary \naction being taken against them. \nIntroduction \nThe objective of this policy is to ensure that all staff understand the company’s commitment to the fair \ntreatment of customers, and their individual responsibility to treat customers fairly and provide loans \nonly when they present neither affordability risk to the borrower nor credit risk to the company. The policy \nsets out the rules that must be followed when considering a loan application, including the criteria that \nmust be applied when assessing whether a loan is affordable. \nThe policy applies to all directors and staff who are involved in assessing or processing and collecting \nloans.  It also applies to all staff who are involved in helping customers who are, or may be, in financial \ndifficulties. Where in-scope business functions or services are outsourced to a third-party, that third-\nparty must and will, fully, comply with this policy.  Any queries regarding the application of this policy \nshould be referred to a director. \nAll current and future employees will comply fully with the individual conduct rules \nset below: \n1. You must act with integrity, \n2. You must act with due skill, care and diligence, \n3. You must be open and cooperative with the FCA, \n4. You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and treat them fairly, \n5. You must observe proper standards of market conduct. \nAll current and future senior managers will comply fully with the senior manager's conduct rules set \nin the SM&CR: \n \n1. You must take reasonable steps to  ensure that the business of the firm  for which you are \nresponsible for is controlled effectively, \n2. You must take reasonable steps to  ensure that the business of the firm  for which you are \nresponsible complies with the relevant requirements and the standards of the regulatory system, \n3. You must take reasonable steps to ensure that any delegation of your responsibilities is to an \nappropriate person and that you oversee the discharge of the delegated responsibility effectively, \n4. You must disclose appropriately any information of which the FCA would reasonably expect \nnotice. \nRegulation \nAs a consumer credit business, SLPL is regulated by the FCA whose Principles for Businesses include the \nfollowing requirements that are directly relevant to the activity of responsible lending and credit \nassessment. \n\n8 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \nThe Consumer Credit Sourcebook (“CONC”) is the specialist sourcebook for credit-related regulated \nactivities by which SLPL is bound. CONC set out detailed rules and guidance that are specific to credit-\nrelated regulated activities and activities connected to those activities carried on by firms.  \nSections of CONC which directly relate to this Affordability and Creditworthiness Policy are: \n \n CONC 2 – Conduct of business standards. \n CONC 3 – Financial promotions and communications with customers. \n CONC 4 – pre-contractual requirements. \n CONC 5 – Responsible Lending. \n CONC 5A – Cost Cap for High-Cost Short Term Credit; and \n CONC 6 – Post Contractual Requirements. \n \nHowever, CONC does not represent a ‘catch-all’. We are also aware of obligations contained in other \nHandbook sections especially PRIN, SYSC and DISP. the detailed obligations specific to credit \nactivities are: \n \n➢ Principle 1 - a firm must conduct its business with integrity. \n➢ Principle 2 - a firm must conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence. \n➢ Principle 3 - a firm must take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly and \neffectively, with adequate risk management systems \n➢ Principle 4 - a firm must maintain adequate financial resources \n➢ Principle 6 - a firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly. \n➢ Principle 8 - a firm must manage conflicts of interest fairly, both between itself and its customers \nand between a customer and another client. \n➢ Principle 11 - a firm must deal with its regulators in an open and cooperative way and must \ndisclose to the appropriate regulator appropriately anything relating to the firm of which that \nregulator would reasonably expect notice. \nIn general terms, Creditors should: \n➢ make a reasonable assessment of whether  a borrower can afford to meet repayments in a \nsustainable manner \n➢ explain the key features of the credit agreement, to enable the borrower to make an informed \nchoice \n➢ monitor  the  borrower’s  repayment  record  over  the  course  of  the  agreement,  helping  where \nborrowers appear to be experiencing difficulty. \n➢ treat borrowers fairly and with forbearance if they experience difficulties and ensure that all \ncollections activity is proportionate. \n\n9 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \nTreating Customers Fairly \nThe TCF principle aims to raise standards in the way in which firms conduct their business by helping \nconsumers fully understand the financial products available to them, and to minimise the sale of \nunsuitable products by encouraging best practice before, during and after the point of sale.   \nThe TCF principle expands to six core consumer outcomes, explaining what the FCA wants TCF to \nachieve for Consumers.  \nThese are as follows: \n \n➢ Outcome 1: Consumers can be confident they are dealing with firms where the fair treatment of \ncustomers is central to the corporate culture.  \n➢ Outcome 2: Products and services marketed and sold in the retail market are designed to meet \nthe needs of identified consumer groups and are targeted accordingly. \n➢ Outcome 3: Consumers are provided with clear information and are kept appropriately informed \nbefore, during and after point of sale.  \n➢ Outcome 4: Where consumers receive advice, the advice is suitable and takes account of their \ncircumstances.   \n➢ Outcome 5: Consumers are provided with products that perform as firms have led them to expect, \nand the associated service is of an acceptable standard and as they have been led to expect.  \n➢ Outcome 6: Consumers do not face unreasonable post-sale barriers imposed by firms to change \nproduct, switch provider, submit a claim or make a complaint.  \nCommitment to Consumer Duty \nAt SLPL we are committed to delivering good outcomes for all our customers by embedding the \nprinciples of the FCA’s Consumer Duty across every aspect of our business. To meet these standards, \nwe ensure: \n➢ Customer-Centric Product Design: Our products and services are designed to meet the specific \nneeds, objectives, and characteristics of our target customers, particularly those in vulnerable \ncircumstances. \n➢ Appropriateness of Products: Our products are suitable and fair, avoiding any offering that could \nlead to customer detriment. Products and services are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain \nfit for purpose. \n➢ Understanding and Addressing Customer Needs: Our customer base primarily consists of the \nsub-prime population, and it is our responsibility to fully understand their financial challenges, \naverage living costs, and expectations. We align our offerings with these insights to ensure our \nproducts provide value and support their core needs. \n➢ Clear and Transparent Communication: We provide customers with clear, transparent, and \ntimely information at every stage of the customer journey. This enables informed decision-making, \nespecially when customers face financial difficulties. \n\n10 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n➢ Fair and Non-Advised Sales Process: While we do not provide financial advice, we commit to \noffering  unbiased,  easy-to-understand  information  both  online  and  verbally,  empowering \ncustomers to make decisions that are in their best interest. \n➢ Performance and Service Standards: We ensure that our product performs as promised and that \nany associated services meet the standards expected by customers. We monitor and assess these \nservices to ensure they deliver the outcomes customers anticipate. \n➢ Internal Controls and Governance: Internal controls are in place to monitor the effectiveness of \nour compliance with Consumer Duty principles. Assessments ensure that we continue to deliver \nfair value and avoid foreseeable harm to our customers. \n➢ Complaint Handling and Continuous Improvement: We handle complaints in accordance with \nFCA guidelines, with a focus on learning from customer feedback. Complaints are reviewed and \nreported to directors to identify systemic issues and take timely corrective action. \n➢ Training and Staff Awareness: Our staff undergo training and refresher courses to ensure they \nunderstand  and  apply  Consumer  Duty  principles  in  their  day-to-day  actions,  ensuring  we \nconsistently deliver good outcomes for our customers. \n➢ Senior  Management  Accountability: Our  directors  are  accountable  for  embedding  the \nConsumer  Duty  throughout  the  business.  They  are  responsible  for  driving  continuous \nimprovement, ensuring SLPL meets regulatory expectations. \nProviding Loans to Customers \nOur customers are typically non-prime applicants. These customers have usually experienced payment \ndifficulties in the past but are now in a more stable financial position. They are also more vulnerable to \nshort-term gaps in their budgets as they often lack savings to fall back on. This makes products like ours \nessential for helping them move forward without undue stress. \nAt SLPL, we take a more nuanced approach by combining three different sources of data for national rent \naverages, ensuring a balanced view. For cost of living, we use ONS data, which accounts for national \naverages, including the lower-income population, to provide a more accurate reflection of our \ncustomers' financial situations. \nWe then compare this data to what the customer has declared on their application form and base our \naffordability calculation on the higher of the two amounts. This ensures they are not unfairly impacted by \ntheir position within lower income or expenditure brackets, providing a fair and thorough assessment of \ntheir affordability. \nThe detailed process for application assessment is set out below. The principles that drive the \nprocess are as follows: \n \n➢ Our assessment of affordability and creditworthiness considers the customer's ability to repay the \namount of credit applied for. \n➢ as repayments fall due over the lifetime of the agreement. \n➢ out of income (Income includes only net monthly continuous income)  \n➢ without having to borrow to meet the repayments. \n\n11 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n➢ without failing to make any other payment that they have a statutory of contractual obligation to \nmake. \n➢ without the repayments having a negative adverse impact on their financial situation and \n➢ with sufficient Disposable Income Buffer available to the applicant after taking the loan repayment \ninto account.  \n \nWhen assessing ability to repay we take account of the applicant’s essential cost of living and housing \ncost and increase those amounts by an increasing ratio margin that is relative to the loan amount to allow \nfor an outgoing shock during the life of the loan. \nBefore considering an application, all applicants must confirm that they are not aware of any pending \nchanges in their employment status during the loan period (i.e., from loan approval until the final \nrepayment due date). Additionally, prior to signing the agreement, applicants are required to confirm that \nthey are not currently in a debt management plan, individual voluntary arrangement, Debt Respite \nScheme, or any other debt relief process, including bankruptcy, and do not anticipate entering any of \nthese arrangements. These question are included in the to encourage applicants to reflect on their \nfinancial situation and consider whether they might encounter challenges in making sustainable \npayments.    \nIf the applicant discloses that their employment status is going to change during that period and / or their \nincome is expected to reduce, we will decline the application. If the applicant claims that their income \nwill increase, the new income level can only be used together with evidence of the change. In all cases, \nthe underwriting rules with regards to income will be applied based upon the verified income only. \n If, at any stage of the application process, anything is said by the applicant or any information is \notherwise provided to us by any information provider, which suggests the applicant cannot afford to \nrepay the loan applied for on time, without undue difficulty or without resorting to further borrowing from \nalternative sources, the application will be declined.  \nSLPL’s underwriting process checks for inconsistencies in the information provided by the customer \nagainst information received from TransUnion and various other look up tables (see below) in order to \ndetermine the sums of essential monthly expenditures we use for the purpose of affordability \ncalculation.  \nIf the received information from the applicant is inconsistent with the information, we hold the \ninconsistency is investigated. SLPL’s underwriting process differentiates between:  \nAn inconsistency that does not affect the applicant’s affordability and involves minor typos or missing \ntechnical information will be challenged by the underwriter and resolved by reference to either an \nauthoritative public source or by an e-mail reference to the applicant requesting the correction of \nmistaken or missing information and then ,if needed, referred to a manager for review and approval.  \nAn inconsistency that is related to Income, existing credit commitments, housing costs or essential living \nexpenses SLPL will act according to CONC provisions and the UK courts interpretation of the relevant \nCONC 5 subsections: \n \n➢ CONC 5.3.1G(4) has a reference to paragraphs 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15 of the ILG:  \n➢ “It is not generally sufficient for a firm to rely solely for its assessment of the customer’s income \nand expenditure on a statement of those matters made by the customer.”  \n\n12 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n➢ Furthermore, in 2018 the FCA updated CONC 5 requiring that finance companies must take \nreasonable steps to determine the amount, or make a reasonable estimate of, the customer’s \nincome and non-discretionary expenditure  \n \n➢ CONC 5.2.1(3) further provides that: \n➢ A creditworthiness assessment must be based on sufficient information obtained from: \n \na) the customer, where appropriate; and \nb) a credit reference agency, where necessary. \n \nMoreover, HHJ WORSTER concluded in Kerrigan v Elevate Credit in 2020 that: \n“I was satisfied that most of these Claimants were doing their best to give honest answers most \nof the time, even if they turned out not to be accurate, sometimes by significant amounts. That \nsort of conduct is not mendacious” \n \nTherefore, in all cases where a discrepancy exists the standard affordability criteria set for the \naffordability calculation, (see below), will be applied and prevail.  \n \nHaving said that, CONC 5.3.7R says that: \n“A firm must not accept an application for credit under a regulated credit agreement where the \nfirm knows or ought reasonably to suspect that the customer has not been truthful in completing \nthe application in relation to information supplied by the customer relevant to the \ncreditworthiness assessment or the assessment required by CONC 5.2.2R (1).” \n \nTherefore, in applications where the applicant submits information that might have an adverse effect on \nour affordability calculation process in a way that will compromise its accuracy, or it is clear from the \ninformation supplied that the applicant is being deceitful (Income, Monthly expenditures or credit \ncommitment fields returned as zero’s) the application will be declined. \nIf the applicant wishes to appeal the credit decision, they will be required to provide the necessary \nevidence for lower amounts. If that evidence is received, the application is referred to a manager who will \ncheck the evidence provided, update the system with the new information and run the affordability \nassessment again against the new evidenced amounts. If our affordability criteria are fully met, the loan \nis approved. \nAll applications are initiated online. Contact with applicants is via email and recorded telephone line. \nHowever, if during our engagement with a customer at any time we believe that they do not have the \nmental capacity to deal confidently with their loan, or they are in another vulnerable state the application \nis declined. \nFor the purpose of section 6.5 above a vulnerable customer can be identified when their condition \nmatches one or more of the below categories:  \n \n\n13 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n➢ Health – health conditions or illnesses that affect the ability to carry out day to day tasks \n➢ Life Events – major life events such as bereavement or relationship breakdown \n➢ Resilience – low ability to withstand financial or emotional shocks \n➢ Capability – low knowledge of financial matters or low confidence in managing money. \n \nSLPL will: \n➢ always act fairly, reasonably, and responsibly in all our dealings with the customer. \n➢ not pressure the customer to enter into any loan agreement or to extend the term of his/her existing \nloan agreement.  \n➢ inform the customer that a short-term loan should be used for short-term financial needs and is \nnot appropriate for long-term borrowing or if they are in financial difficulty. \n➢ tell the customer clearly how the loan works and the total cost of the loan before the customer \nsigns the credit agreement.  The customer is allowed time to consider the Adequate Explanations \nbefore signing their Credit Agreement.  \n➢ check whether the loan is suitable for the customer taking account of their circumstances and \ncurrent and future financial obligations at the time the lending decision is made.  \n \nIt is our duty to the customer to ensure that the loan presents an acceptable affordability risk for the \ncustomer, and that the customer will be able to make repayments on time, as they fall due and without \nthe payments adversely affecting the customers financial situation. This is the basis on which we \nconsider an application for a loan. This assessment considers current and future foreseeable financial \ncommitments and past financial performance. The pre-vetting automated check process, the Decision \nEngine business rules and the system affordability matrix provide a clear affordable/no affordable \noutcome.  \nApplications can only be made in the name of one individual. Joint applications are not accepted. Only \nthe income of the applicant is used when assessing affordability, so incomes from spouses or partners or \nother parties will not be included. Having said that, customers provide information about their actual \ncontribution to the bills, as this number may be lower than estimated especially where there are multiple \noccupants in a residence We may, in certain cases, where there are strong indications in favour of the \napplicant (salary, good past performance), look more favourably at the credit application and the \naffordability of the customer in order to comply with TCF rules and the customer expectations from us.  \nWhen customers apply for a loan with us, they must provide the following information: \n➢ Full Name. \n➢ Current UK address including duration of residency and whether the home is owned by the \napplicant or rented and the type of rental. The credit search automatically picks up previous \naddresses of the customer. \n➢ Date of birth. \n➢ Mobile telephone number (verified via 2 factor process). \n➢ Purpose of the loan-refinance is immediately declined. \n➢ Email address (verified via 2 factor process). \n\n14 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n➢ Employment details  \n➢ Monthly income request in our application form: “This is the amount you receive in your bank \naccount after tax, national insurance and any pension contributions have been deducted.

This takes account of the information \nwe hold regarding the applicant, the information provided by the applicant, TransUnion data and other \nthird-party statistical tools.  \nThe checks include identification verification of the applicant, fraud checks and detailed application of \nall affordability tests.

Income verification: The customer is working and receives a monthly income into their own bank \naccount. \n2. The customer has a sustainable level of monthly debt repayments. \n3. The loan is affordable, and the customer is left with enough disposable Income (including a buffer) \nafter paying all their credit obligations including the payment of the loan in question and the \nmonthly essential and living expenditure that the customer is responsible for. \nIncome verification \nThe customer’s income must be verified by the CATO data provided by the TransUnion Affordability \nReport. If the applicant’s income is not verified (a minimum of 7 green) the underwriter will seek Income \nevidence. Where the TU Affordability Report can confirm the applicant’s income to within 10% of the \nstated amount (amber 7, 8, or 9) this income is viewed as verified but for the purposes of the disposable \nincome calculation it is reduced by 10%. Where the affordability report returns as Red <7 or flagged as a \njoint account, we request evidence from the customer in the form of a recent payslip or bank statement. \n \n \n \n \nOtherwise, additional proof of income is required. \nSufficient disposable income \nIt is essential to evidence sufficient disposable income including an income buffer. The reason for this is \nthat the applicant might be approaching a situation where their overall debt level may become \nunmanageable and for consistency and unambiguity in our underwriting methodology, we decided to \ncategorically decline such applications. If the disposable income, including the buffer we apply, falls \nbelow 0, our system will automatically prevent the application from progressing to sign-off. \nDisposable Income and Sustainable Lending \nTo assess whether the loan is affordable our system will calculate an estimation of the applicant’s costs \nof living considering the applicants unique circumstances to achieve the most accurate estimation for \nthe purpose of checking whether the loan is affordable.  \n \nAFFORDABILITY RISK \nIncome\nIF ICF <= 7, Evidence, IF RAG = R, Evidence, IF \nRAG = A, DeclaredIncome*0.9, DeclaredIncome\nAFFORDABILITY RISK Income verified - 100%\n( [TACJointIndicator] <> \"true\" and ( ( \n[TACincomemax] = \"Low\" and ( \n[TACincomecon] = \"7\" or [TACincomecon] = \"8\" \nor [TACincomecon] = \"9\" ) ) ) )\nAFFORDABILITY RISK Income verified - 90%\n( [TACJointIndicator] <> \"true\" and ( ( \n[TACincomemax] = \"Medium\" and ( \n[TACincomecon] = \"7\" or [TACincomecon] = \"8\" \nor [TACincomecon] = \"9\" ) ) ) )\nAFFORDABILITY RISK Income not verifiedJoint flag or ICF < 7 or RAG = High\n\n17 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n \n \nIn order to achieve this goal as far as rent expenses are concerned, our underwriting affordability \ncalculation averages three independent and unrelated sources of information I.e., HomeLet, ONS, and \nInfinian look up tables. (Here and after “HOI Matrix”).  \nThe HOI Matrix provides a reasonable view, look up table regarding average rent costs as a proportion of \nincome, region and residential status. The figure provided by the HOI Matrix is compared with the rent \nstated in the application and the calculation will be based on the higher number between the two. When \na customer has indicated they are a tenant, the most current HOI figure (updated at least once a year) is \nused to determine the percentage of income to be calculated. Where the applicant indicates in the \napplication form that two or more people share the household financial obligations, we may, in certain \ncases only and where it is evident it is reasonable to do so (Mortgage paid from a joint account) to adjust \nthe HOI outcome to accommodate this to keep up with TCF and customer expectations from us.  For \nsingle applicants we use 100% of the figure derived by the HOI. \nFor a customer that resides with parents and declares they have no rental costs we will consider (for the \npurpose of the affordability calculation) the rent cost to be a minimum 10% of a customer’s monthly net \nincome.  \nEssential Living expenses \nFor essential living expenses, we will compare the declared living expenses of the applicant against the \nnational averages provided by ONS which combine the average cost of living based on income decile. \nWhen calculating affordability, the system will consider the higher between the ONS estimation and the \ncustomer-declared expenses  \n\n18 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n                 \n \n \nAlthough the ONS report is published once a year, we actively monitor inflation throughout the year and \nadjust our affordability calculations accordingly to ensure they reflect current economic conditions. \nCredit commitments \nThe matrix calculation will compare the declared credit commitments of the applicant with the “real time \npicture” of the applicant’s financial situation and their ongoing credit obligations provided by \nTransUnion’s affordability report. \nThus, for the purpose of calculating the applicant’s prudent disposable income the system Matrix will \ncalculate as follows (using the most prudent value between the self-declared value and the system \nestimation): \n \na) Customer’s monthly verified income \nb) Minus rent/mortgage  cost,  monthly  Living  Expenses  and  were  relevant  dependents  cost, \nmonthly credit servicing costs, future payments for the loan requested \nc) = Adjusted disposable income \n \nThe result must show a positive Disposable Income to which we deduct a further buffer to allow for a \nfuture unexpected outgoing shock as noted below. \nDisposable income buffer \nAs customers may be subject to possible unforeseen expense shocks from time to time, in addition to \nthe above calculation outcome, although positive, we add a further buffer. Such occasions might include \ncar breakdown, domestic equipment repairs or some other unplanned expenditure.  \nThe buffer figures take account of the living costs and housing costs and increase those by percentages \nranging from 10% to 18% to reflect the loan size payments and the income of the applicant. As illustrated \nthe buffer increases as the loan repayment / amount increases. This provides additional protection to the \ncustomer based on their increase in outgoings.  \n \n \nEXAMPLE \n£100-£200£200-£400£400-£600£600-£800>£800\nNMIHOUCOL\nTOTAL B4 \nCR10%12.0%14%16.00%18%\n20005006001100110132154176198\nMINIMUM £100\nBUFFER\n\n19 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n \nOur affordability check process ensures that we will lend only when we are positive that the loan \npresents an acceptable affordability risk to the borrower and the borrower will not struggle to repay their \nloan. \nThe Decision Engine process has three possible outcomes: \n➢ Immediate decline. No further processing takes place, and the applicant is advised by e-mail \nthat their application has been unsuccessful. \n➢ Provisional acceptance which moves the application to Visual Inspection. \n➢ Additional Information, where more information/evidence is required, and the customer is \nnotified of the information they need to provide. \nIn order to complete the underwriting process, the application will be reviewed by an \nunderwriter manually. This is discussed below. \nVisual Inspection \nAll applications that have been Provisionally Accepted in the Decision Engine assessment are subject to \nvisual inspection by an Underwriter. The visual inspection is essentially part of the Quality Assurance \nprocess and is designed to check that the information used in the TransUnion reports and the other \nsources of information used is accurate, complete and in line with all the information we hold in regard to \nthe applicant. \nDuring the visual inspection the Underwriter: \n➢ Visually  inspects  the  application  for  completeness,  ensuring  that  the  matrix  outputs  and \ninformation provided by the TransUnion reports was used correctly.  \n➢ Visually inspects the TransUnion reports for any indicators of inconsistency or inaccuracy. \n➢ Visually inspects any warning signs or negative credit markers, such as defaults, judgments, late \npayments, etc. \n \nIf the data applied for the purpose of the affordability calculation is found to be complete and accurate, \nthere are no indications of fraud and no negative CRA information is identified, the application is \napproved, and the loan is passed into the payment queue. \nIf there are referrals from the Decision Engine regarding income credit history or application data, the \nUnderwriter contacts the applicant by e-mail and requests further information or evidence as per the \nReferral process. \nWhere the information or evidence provided by the applicant is not sufficient as per the Referral process \nbelow, or where no response is received within 48 hours, the application is declined, and the customer is \nadvised by e-mail by the Underwriter. \nReferral Process \nAll applications marked as Refer by the Decision Engine or which have required changes or additional \ninformation at the Visual Inspection step are subject to a review.  \nThe process essentially involves a detailed review of the application and any further information that the \napplicant provides and an assessment against the affordability criteria. All applications must meet the \naffordability criteria in full to be approved.  \n \n\n20 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \nThe process for dealing with Referred applications is as follows: \n \na) Firstly, the underwriter will review the output from the automated decision engine and identify \nwhat areas, if any, need to be reviewed to ensure the customer is acceptable.  \nb) Depending on the outcome of this review, the underwriter will decide what information is needed \nbefore the loan can be issued.  \nc) If we are unable to identify the customer, we will need some proof of identity such as a passport or \ndriving licence. If the customer cannot be identified the application will be declined. \nd) If we cannot find the customer at their address as part of the AML checks, we will need proof of \naddress such as a driving licence or an official document with the customer's address on it dated \nwithin the last 3 months. If we can see the customer has moved recently, we will enter the previous \naddress  as  well  to  ensure  that  the  TransUnion  reports  reflect  fully  the  customer’s  financial \nsituation.  \nPayslips/Bank Statements \nA most recent payslip or bank statement may be requested to support the application were deemed \nnecessary, including where the Trans Union Affordability Report has been unable to verify income. The \nreview will follow the steps detailed below. \nStatement review process: \n➢ Income matches the application data - The validation process will look to verify the applicant \nmonthly income.  \n➢ Expenditure items that fit within the relevant values for credit commitments and living costs we \nuse for the affordability assessment. \n \nSigns of financial difficulty or dependency on credit including: \n➢ Unauthorised overdrafts \n➢ Returned payments \n➢ New credit account openings  \n \nGambling and Gaming - Once we see a bank statement that has gaming or gambling transactions, we will \ninclude the average of three months' monthly expenditure as a non-discretionary spend to ensure that \nthe customer's disposable income is affected by the normal spending.  \nWe will also look at the number of transactions per month and the percentage of income that is spent on \nthis, to identify if a customer has a gambling issue.  \nWe regard more than 15 transactions or 15% of income being spent on gaming and gambling as a sign of \naddiction and will decline the application.  \nOpen Banking  \nWe will use a third-party provider for open banking data where the customer applies for a third loan. \nOpen banking data will provide categorised income and expenditure from the customer's bank \nstatements for up to 12 months. This will allow us to look at summarised data to identify items that are of \ninterest for any of the issues discussed above.  \n\n21 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n \nBelow are detailed the specific referral issues along with the expected tasks associated with them: \nIssue Action \nIf income is not validated by TU \nAffordability    report    as \nspecified    earlier,    then \nevidence of income is required  \n➢ Requests direct evidence to confirm the income level. \n➢ Once evidence is received the Underwriter updates the system \nwith the correct figure. If the underwriter is not satisfied with \nthe quality of the evidence the case is passed to a manager \n➢ If  the  evidence  meets  the  affordability  criteria  the  loan  is \napproved.  \n➢ If no evidence is received within 48 hours, the application is \ndeclined by the Underwriter. \n➢ If the income level based on the new evidence is not sufficient \nto  meet  the  underwriting  and  affordability  criteria,  the \napplication is declined by the Underwriter. \n➢ Reviews the evidence  \n➢ Reviews  Decision  Engine  outcomes  and  affordability \ncalculations based on new income evidence. \n➢ If based on the evidence, the affordability criteria are met, the \nloan is Approved. \n➢ If  the  underwriter  is  not  satisfied  with  the  quality  of  the \nevidence, then the application is declined \n \nCredit commitments \nunderstated  or  overstated  by \nmore  than  10  %  when \ncompared to CRA data. \n \n \nSystem will always use the higher figure for credit commitments for \ncalculating  the  applicant’s  affordability  and  standard  affordability \ncriteria will apply.  \nIf the figure has been understated by the applicant in comparison to the \ncredit report and the applicant failed the affordability assessment the \nunderwriter may upon appeal from the applicant or, in certain cases \nwhere fraud is suspected contact the applicant and request evidence \nfor  the  lowered  credit  commitments.  Acceptable  evidence  is  the \nLender’s  Official  Letter  or bank  statement  confirming  a  loan/credit \ncommitment is paid off.  \nIf  information  is  not  received  within  48  hours  the  application  is \ndeclined.  \nIf evidence is received covering the credit commitments difference as \nper the CRA report, then the following actions will take place. \n \n\n22 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \n➢ Verifies that the new information received covers one or more \nof the credit commitments on the CRA file. \n➢ Updates  the  system  matrix  with  the  new  lowered  credit \ncommitments figure as proven from the evidence received \nfrom applicant.  \n➢ Runs  the  affordability  assessment  again  with  new  lowered \nfigure according to standard affordability rules. \n➢ Examines  that  the  new  information  received  is  in  order. \nReviews that the new input figure uploaded to the system is \ncorrect. \n➢ Checks that the affordability assessment was run properly. \n➢ If  the  affordability  criteria  are  not  met  the  application  is \ndeclined. \n➢ If the affordability criteria are met the application is approved \nand passed into the payment queue. \n  \nRent costs are understated or \noverstated by more than 10% \ncompared  to  HOI  data. \n \n \n \nThe system will use the higher Rent figure for calculating the applicant’s \naffordability and standard affordability criteria will apply.  \nIf the figure has been understated by the applicant in comparison to the \nHOI Matrix and the applicant failed the affordability assessment the \nunderwriter may upon Appel from the applicant or, in certain cases \nwhere fraud is suspected contact the applicant and request evidence \nof lowered Rent costs.

If the criteria \nare met, the loan is Approved and passed into the payment \nqueue. \n➢ If no information is received or the applicant’s claim is found to \nbe invalid, the application is declined. \nIf  the  customer  appeals  a \ndecline decision. \n \n➢ The  underwriter  collects  documentary  evidence  of  the \ninformation the customer claims is incorrect (as per the rules \nabove),  updates  the  system,  recalculates  affordability  and \npasses to a Manager for review.  \n➢ A Manager not involved in the initial assessment reviews the \napplication and the appeal in full and applies the standard \naffordability criteria. If the criteria are met, the loan is approved \nand passed into the payment queue. \n➢ If the criteria are not met, the application is declined.  \n \n \nQuality Assurance \nThere is a Quality Assurance process that covers Approved applications. The assessment involves a full \nre-assessment of each application based upon all information held on the system. \n \nThe QA process will include: \n \n➢ 10% of all approved loans from the previous day. \n \nWhere individual Underwriters are found not to have applied the affordability criteria accurately, the \nissue will be discussed with them. Where there is continued non-compliance, the issue will be handled \neither as a training or a competence issue. \n \nThe performance of the loan book will be kept under constant review and, where outcomes are not in line \nwith expectations, this will be addressed at a portfolio level. \n\n25 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \nCommunications with Customers  \nWe explain how we will communicate with the customer during the term of the loan, how \npayments will be deducted from their bank account and how the customer can contact us by phone, \nemail or online. \nWe set out clearly how the Continuous Payment Authority (“CPA”) works and the customer’s right to \ncancel this authority, so the customer can decide if this type of repayment is acceptable to them. We will \nremind the customer that if the customer cancels, they will still owe any outstanding debt and will need \nto provide an alternative method of repayment on the due date to avoid going into default. \nWe explain a maximum £15 extra charge may be added to the account if the account goes into arrears or \ndefault. \n If the customer is having problems repaying their loan, we will: \n➢ Show forbearance and deal with cases of financial difficulty sympathetically and positively and do \neverything possible to help the customer manage what the customer owes i.e., by way of a suitable \nrepayment plan. \n➢ We will deal with the customer’s representatives when they are asked to act on their behalf.  We \nwill put the customer’s account on hold for an appropriate period in order to facilitate a repayment \nagreement. \n➢ We will also inform the customer about free and independent debt counselling organisations that \ncan also help the customer. \nIf the customer wants to make a complaint, we will: \n➢ Inform the customer about our complaints handling procedure when the customer takes out a \nloan or whenever the customer asks us to.  \n➢ We also include details about our complaint procedure on our website. \n➢ We explain to the customer that they have ultimate recourse to the Financial Ombudsman’s \nservice and provide information on how they can do this if they choose.  \n             The customer journey for applying for a loan is detailed in Annex A. \nRepeat Borrowing \nWhen considering applications for a new loan after a loan (capital and all charges) has been repaid in full, \nwe will conduct the same checks as if the loan application is submitted for the first time as noted above \nto ensure that the loan will be affordable; and presents minimal risk for the customer. \nAs repeat borrowing can indicate additional financial concerns that may not be apparent for standard \ncredit checks, the company applies even stricter procedure. A customer cannot receive more than 3 \nHCSTC loans from SLPL. The criteria for receiving a 3rd loan involve a stricter underwriting process to \nassess the customer's reliance on short-term loans and overall financial health. The customer must \nconsent to open banking. The applicant will be asked to consent to an open banking arrangement \nbetween loans two and three. We will consider, again, all the credit and housing expenses and  income \nwill be validated again. We will check for any signs of financial difficulties, gambling problems or missing \npayments that might indicate a financial difficulty.  \nOur lending policy prohibits paying off a loan and taking a new one immediately after. A cooling-off period \nof 30 days is required between loans 1 and 2, 60 days between loans 2 and 3. Since July 2024 we have \nrestricted maximum lifetime loans from SLPL to 3 from the previous maximum of 4. \n \n\n26 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \nAppendix A  Customer Journey \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n pplica on  orm\n ntered  ecei ed\n reliminar   hec s\n all  eport\n S  Scorecard\n ‐Sign contracts\n mail SMS\n nder ri ng  e ie \n redit  ssessment\n  orda ilit   hec  \nIncome  alida on\n an   hec \n all  alidate I   M \n unds  rocessing\n ard  hec  ecline\n uplicate\n e  customer  ith \nexis ng email\nHas  pen  oan\n e  email  or exis ng \ncustomer\nSo   hec \n raud  hec \n pen  an ing‐in case \ncustomer re uests or in \ncase o  repea ng \n orro ing \n\n27 | P  a  g  e  Responsible Lending Policy \nAppendix B Software System \n \n➢ Fully integrated with web application forms allowing web traffic, affiliate campaigns and “ping \ntree “broker relationships. \n➢ Can operate multiple scorecards simultaneously \n➢ In built proprietary fraud prevention tools and case matching algorithms to prevent customers \nobtaining multiple loans, re-lending to delinquent and “likelihood of fraud” indicators.  \n➢ Triangulated e-signature verification using e-mail and SMS functionality. \n➢ Task  driven  workflow  ensuring  that  a  customer  account  can  never  be  missed  or  \nforgotten. \nIntegrated scheduling allowing: \n1.

Customers can expect to receive financial products that meet their \nneeds and to interact with a firm they can trust. Our TCF commitment includes: \n• Providing clear, accurate, and non-misleading information. \n• Supporting customers facing financial difficulties with empathy and understanding. \n• Regularly reviewing and updating policies on complaints, responsible lending, vulnerable \ncustomers, and debt collection. \nThis policy outlines SLPL’s approach to embedding a TCF culture throughout the organisation, ensuring \nfair treatment at every stage of the customer journey. Our staff, from call centre agents to senior \nmanagement, receive ongoing training to uphold TCF values, with a Quality Assurance (QA) programme \nin place to monitor and maintain high service standards. \n \nTreating Customers Fairly – The Six Outcomes \nSLPL recognises the importance of the six consumer outcomes as defined by the FCA, which guide the \nfirm's culture and operations to ensure the fair treatment of customers. The six outcomes are: \n1. Outcome 1: Consumers can be confident that they are dealing with firms where the fair \ntreatment of customers is central to the corporate culture. \n2. Outcome 2: Products and services marketed and sold are designed to meet the needs of \nidentified consumer groups and are targeted accordingly. \n3. Outcome 3: Consumers are provided with clear information and are kept appropriately informed \nbefore, during, and after the point of sale. \n4. Outcome 4: Where consumers receive advice, it is suitable and takes account of their \ncircumstances. \n5. Outcome 5: Consumers are provided with products that perform as firms have led them to \nexpect, and the associated service is of an acceptable standard. \n6. Outcome 6: Consumers do not face unreasonable post-sale barriers to changing product, \nswitching provider, submitting a claim, or making a complaint. \n \nHow SLPL Addresses the Six Outcomes \n1. Central to Corporate Culture: \no SLPL ensures a customer-centric culture, with Senior Management actively involved in \nfrontline operations and regular reviews of TCF objectives. Staff at all levels undergo \ntraining on TCF principles, supported by QA programmes that monitor calls, emails, and \nlive chats. \no Our core values, mission, and vision are displayed across our premises, and we \nregularly assess staff performance against these values. \no Lending criteria are reviewed and aligned with PS18/19, ensuring loans are only made to \ncustomers who can repay without entering financial difficulty. \n2. Targeting the Right Consumer Groups: \n\n4 | Page  Treating Customers Fairly Policy \no SLPL ensures its products are marketed responsibly. Information on our website clearly \noutlines that payday loans are a short-term credit solution and may not be suitable for \nlong-term borrowing or customers in financial difficulty. \no We display product details on an FCA-authorised price comparison website to \nincrease transparency. \n3. Clear Information: \no We provide clear information on charges, risks, and benefits, ensuring customers have \neverything they need to make informed borrowing decisions. \no Our website FAQs, chatbot functionality, and customer service team are available to \naddress any queries before, during, or after the sale. Post-contractual information is \nissued promptly, and reminders are sent as repayments become due. \n4. Suitable Advice: \no While SLPL does not provide regulated financial advice, our customer service team \nensures that customer interactions consider individual circumstances. Our QA \nprogramme reviews calls to ensure customers receive suitable guidance based on their \nsituation. \n5. Product Performance: \no SLPL products are straightforward, and the terms and costs are clearly explained in pre-\nsale documentation. We regularly review feedback and complaints to assess product \nperformance and customer satisfaction. \no Data privacy and protection are top priorities, with consent sought before data sharing in \nline with GDPR requirements. \n6. No Post-Sale Barriers: \no Customers can withdraw from their loan contract within 14 days or settle early without \npenalties. Our Complaints Policy is accessible and transparent, ensuring that \ncustomers can easily raise concerns and expect a fair response. \n \nManagement Information \nSLPL actively monitors TCF outcomes through management information (MI) reports, which track key \nmetrics such as: \n• Sales volumes, acceptance rates, and e-sign rates. \n• Complaint volumes and outcomes. \n• Arrears rates and payment plan breakage rates. \n• Customer service performance, including response times and agent tasks. \nMI is discussed at Senior Management Team (SMT) meetings, with actions taken to address any \nemerging risks to fair customer outcomes. \n \n\n5 | Page  Treating Customers Fairly Policy \nTCF Culture Framework \nThe FCA’s culture framework, based on six key drivers, forms the foundation of SLPL’s TCF approach. \nSLPL regularly reviews its policies and procedures to ensure alignment with these drivers: \nIndicators Key drivers Contra-indicators \nFair treatment of \ncustomers is central to \nthe behaviour and values \nof all managers, they \ncommunicate messages \nabout the fair treatment of \ncustomers effectively and \napply appropriate \ncontrols and monitoring \nto ensure that the fair \ntreatment of customers is \ndelivered by their staff. \n \n \n \n \n \nLeadership \nManagers (at any level) \ncannot explain and/or do \nnot communicate what the \nfair treatment of customers \nmeans for them and their \nstaff and cannot \ndemonstrate that their staff \nunderstand what the fair \ntreatment of customers \nmeans. \nThe firm has a clear vision \nwhich supports the fair \ntreatment of customers. \nThis is reflected within \nthe formulation and \nimplementation of \nstrategic decisions \n(including change \nmanagement programmes \nand outsource \narrangements).

Vulnerability can be present in \nmany forms and is not just related to mental capacity. We understand a vulnerable customer to be one \nwho may be particularly susceptible to detriment due to their personal and current circumstances. This \npolicy takes account of many published sources of research and information on achieving better \noutcomes for vulnerable customers and we are committed to treating vulnerable customers fairly and \nrespectfully, offering flexible outcomes. This approach is embedded throughout our business and forms \npart of our “treating customers fairly” approach. At Savvy Loan Products Limited (SLPL), we train our \nstaff to listen to the caller on the end of the phone and to respond appropriately to their circumstances. \nWe will offer alternative methods of communication where possible. \nSavvy Loan Products Limited (SLPL)’s Approach to Vulnerability \nCustomer-Centric Business Objective \nOur objective is to pay due regard to the interests of our customers and treat them fairly. We understand \nthe need for “fair and appropriate treatment of customers whom we understand or reasonably suspect \nto be particularly vulnerable.” (CONC 7.2.1). We follow guidance from the FCA found in FG21/1: \nGuidance for firms on the fair treatment of vulnerable customers, outlines key obligations for firms \nregarding vulnerable customers \nFCA Expectations and Guiding Principles \nThere are a number of key expectations that the FCA requires from regulated firms when dealing with \nvulnerable customers. Firms have a duty to identify, understand, and respond to vulnerable \ncustomers' needs appropriately. The key obligations include: \n• Identifying Vulnerability: Firms are expected to have processes in place to identify customers \nwho may be vulnerable. This can include proactive identification by staff or information provided \nby the customer. \n• Tailored Support: Once a customer is identified as vulnerable, the firm should offer additional \nsupport tailored to their needs. This could include things like more flexible communication \nmethods, clearer explanations, or forbearance in cases of financial difficulty. \n• Staff Training: Employees should be adequately trained to recognize signs of vulnerability and \nknow how to support vulnerable customers. \n• Product and Service Design: Firms should consider the needs of vulnerable customers in the \ndesign of their products, services, and customer journeys. \n• Monitoring Outcomes: Firms should monitor how they are treating vulnerable customers and \nwhether they are achieving good outcomes for them. \nRecognising and Understanding Vulnerability \nUnderstanding Vulnerability Complexity \nVulnerability is never solely about the characteristics or situation of the individual but also involves the \nactions of firms, agencies, or organisations. It also emphasises the fact that everyone is potentially \nvulnerable to detriment while also requiring organisations to think about individuals. \nRisk Factor Approach to Identifying Vulnerability \nRisk factors are useful in that they capture not only the varied and fluctuating nature of vulnerability but \nalso cover the interaction between the individual and us. Further, identifying risk factors reduces the \nneed to categorise or stereotype groups. Examples of individual risk factors for vulnerability may be: \n\n \n4 | Pa ge  Vulnerable Customer Policy                            \n• Being ‘older old’ (e.g., over 80), which may be associated with cognitive or dexterity impairment, \nsensory impairments such as hearing or sight, the onset of ill-health, or not being comfortable \nwith new technology. \n• Low literacy, numeracy, and financial capability skills. \n• Physical disability. \n• Severe or long-term illness. \n• Mental health problems. \n• Low income and/or debt. \n• Caring responsibilities (including operating a power of attorney). \n• Being young (associated with less experience). \n• Change in circumstances (e.g., job loss, bereavement, divorce). \n• Lack of English language skills. \nDiverse Nature of Vulnerability \nVulnerability can be both short-term, longer-term, and permanent, and it is important that we \nunderstand the difference and the influence of time on vulnerability. Examples of permanent \nvulnerabilities include people who have learning difficulties, consumers with low literacy levels, or \ncultural barriers such as language. Short-term vulnerabilities are those which relate to more sudden \nchanges in circumstances such as loss of employment, income, or bereavement, which can lead to what \nis commonly known as ‘financial shock’. Some vulnerabilities may last for a limited period of time and \nothers may re-occur regularly, for example, around the anniversary or special date related to a bereaved \nrelative. \nChallenges in Decision Making and Information Reception \nIn many of these cases, consumers may have difficulty in making an informed decision about the \nchoices offered to them. In others, consumers may have difficulty receiving the information in the \nmanner it is usually presented, for example, those with hearing or visual impairments. The March 2017 \nresearch by the Personal Finance Research Centre suggests vulnerability can be thought of as the \nproduct of three intertwined strands: \nThree Dimensions of Vulnerability \n1. Individual factors such as a health condition or emotional state. \n2. Wider circumstances such as life events or sudden household changes. \n3. Organisational actions (or inaction). \nFair Treatment of Vulnerable Customers \nAt Savvy Loan Products Limited (SLPL), we are committed to treating vulnerable customers fairly, \nensuring their unique needs are addressed with care and sensitivity. Our established processes reflect \nthe principles outlined by the FCA to identify, support, and monitor vulnerable customers throughout \ntheir journey with us. \nIdentifying Vulnerability \nWe have processes in place to identify customers who may be vulnerable. Our staff are trained to \nproactively recognise signs of vulnerability, whether through verbal communication, or the information \n\n \n5 | Pa ge  Vulnerable Customer Policy                            \nthey provide during our interactions. This allows us to respond swiftly and appropriately to the \ncustomer’s changing circumstances. \nTailored Support \nUpon identifying a vulnerable customer, we offer additional, tailored support. This can include offering \nflexible repayment options, simplified communication to suit the customer’s needs, and, where \nnecessary, forbearance on payments. Our commitment is to develop customised action plans that \naddress the specific situation of the customer, whether that involves repayment terms, temporary \npayment freezes, or alternative solutions that fit their financial circumstances. \nEncouraging Self-Disclosure \nWe encourage customers to disclose any vulnerabilities on their journey with us. This allows us to \nprovide the necessary support early and ensure that our approach is tailored to their specific needs. \nIdentifying Red Flags \nOur staff are trained to identify signs such as difficulties in communication, or processing information. \nThese red flags trigger an escalation process, allowing our specialist to step in and offer further \nassistance when necessary. \nLife Shock Assistance \nWe continue to provide tailored assistance for customers facing life shocks, including job loss, divorce, \nor bereavement. Our process includes measures such as write-offs, reduced interest rates, temporary \nfreezing of accounts, and repayment plans to help customers regain financial stability during \nchallenging times. \nRequesting Evidence of Vulnerability \nAt Savvy Loan Products Limited (SLPL), we recognise the importance of supporting vulnerable \ncustomers without creating unnecessary barriers. While it may be reasonable in certain situations to \nrequest evidence of vulnerability, we ensure that any such requests are always proportionate, relevant, \nand handled with care. \nMinimal Documentation Approach \nIn most cases, we do not require formal proof of vulnerability. We trust our customers' declarations and \nwill take their word when they disclose vulnerability. For example, if a customer indicates they are \nfacing health challenges, we may accept a simple note from a healthcare provider, such as a doctor or \nsocial worker, if appropriate to the situation. This minimal documentation helps us provide the \nnecessary support without imposing excessive requirements. \nRequesting Reasonable Evidence \nWhere we do ask for evidence, it is always directly related to the specific type of vulnerability. Examples \nof reasonable requests include: \n• A doctor’s note or medical report for health-related issues. \n• Financial statements or a document confirming a change in employment status for customers \nexperiencing financial distress. \nIn all cases, the documentation requested is kept as simple and unobtrusive as possible, ensuring it \ndoes not create additional stress or delays for the customer. \nAvoiding Burdensome Requirements \nWe are committed to avoiding any undue burden on our customers. We will never ask for excessive or \nrepeated documentation and always exercise discretion, understanding that some customers may \nstruggle to provide formal evidence due to their circumstances. \n\n \n6 | Pa ge  Vulnerable Customer Policy                            \nDiscretion and Flexibility \nRecognising the variety of vulnerabilities our customers may face; we remain flexible in what we \nrequest. For customers experiencing difficulty in providing formal documentation, we work with them to \nfind an alternative solution, ensuring they still receive the support they need without unnecessary delay. \nConfidentiality \nAll information related to a customer’s vulnerability is handled with the utmost confidentiality. We only \nuse this information to provide appropriate support and ensure it is protected in line with data \nprotection standards. \nMental Capacity \nMental capacity is a person’s ability to make a decision. Whether or not a consumer has the ability to \nunderstand, remember, and weigh up information will determine whether the consumer is able to make \na responsible borrowing decision. Examples of a person’s ability to make a decision may include \ncustomers with a diagnosed condition like dementia; those who have an undiagnosed or temporary \nmental health condition such as severe anxiety; those with learning difficulties or literacy issues; or \nthose who have problems understanding the language. These issues may be less temporary than some \nother indicators of vulnerability and we try to pay particular attention to these cases. \nSavvy Loan Products Limited (SLPL) assumes a customer has mental capacity at the time the decision \nmust be made unless it has reason to believe or suspect otherwise. If we have reason to believe that the \ncustomer has mental capacity issues, we must not presume that they are unable to make an informed \ndecision when borrowing. \nIf we do suspect or identify that a customer has a disability, we will make reasonable adjustments to \naccommodate them – for example, ensuring that the consumer fully understands the pre-contract \ninformation they have been sent and the agreement they are entering into. We understand indications of \nmental capacity to be: \n• If an existing customer makes a decision that appears to be unexpected or out of character. \n• If a person who has an “informed view of the matter” raises a concern with us. \n• We understand or have reason to believe the customer has been diagnosed as having a mental \ncapacity limitation which led to the customer not having had mental capacity for similar \ndecisions in the past. \n• We have reason to believe that the customer does not understand the product they are applying \nfor. \n• We think the customer is unable to understand the information and explanations we provide. \n• The customer is confused about personal information such as date of birth, postcode, and home \naddress. \n• The customer asks unrelated questions or keeps repeating themselves. \n• The customer asks us to speak up or speak more slowly. \nCommon causes of mental capacity include those listed below and this list may assist in the \nidentification of mental incapacity: \n• Mental health conditions \n• Dementia \n\n \n7 | Pa ge  Vulnerable Customer Policy                            \n• Learning disabilities \n• Developmental disorders \n• Neurological disability or brain injury \n• Alcohol or drug (including prescribed drugs) induced intoxication. \nIf Savvy Loan Products Limited (SLPL) has reasonable grounds to believe that a customer lacks the \nmental capacity to make relevant financial decisions regarding the management of their debt, we will \nsuspend the pursuit of recovery of the debt for a reasonable period to allow relevant evidence to be \nprovided as to the likely impact of the mental capacity problem on the customer’s ability to deal with \nthe debt. We will send the customer a copy of the “The Debt and Mental Health Evidence Form” along \nwith the appropriate consent form for the customer’s health care professional to complete and return to \nus. We have regard to the Money Advice Liaison Group (MALG) Good Practice Awareness Guidelines for \ncustomers with mental health problems and debt. \nServing Vulnerable Customers \nListening and Responding to Customers \nListening to the customer can provide a useful first step in the identification of a potentially vulnerable \nsituation. At Savvy Loan Products Limited (SLPL), we train our staff to listen to the caller on the end of \nthe phone and to respond appropriately to their circumstances. In particular, our staff are alert to: \n• The caller asking us to speak up or speak more slowly. \n• Caller appearing confused, for example, repeating themselves, asking unrelated questions, \ntalking about irrelevancies, or saying “yes” to a question when it is clear that the caller has not \ntaken in what has been asked. \n• The caller taking a long time to get to the phone, sounding flustered and out of breath. \n• The caller takes a long time to answer questions and often says “A relative deals with these \nmatters”. \n• Language barriers. \nWe respond to these circumstances by, for example: \n• Ensuring staff speak clearly and enunciate. \n• Setting expectations for the call – what will be required and how long it is likely to last. \n• Being patient and not rushing the caller. \n• Guiding the call to ensure it remains on topic. \n• Clarifying understanding, offering explanations, repeating, or paraphrasing information. \n• Listening for omissions in the conversation. \n• Asking if the caller would prefer a third party to be present or would like to call back after \nconsidering the information presented. \n• Not always assuming consumers are sighted or can hear everything that is said. \n\n \n8 | Pa ge  Vulnerable Customer Policy                            \nAssistance in Collections \nIf a customer’s circumstances change after receiving funding, we prioritise treating them with dignity \nand forbearance. With explicit consent, we engage more deeply with the customer, making detailed \nnotes, and provide a \"breathing space\" period to allow them to regroup. During this time, we help \narrange affordable repayment plans, signpost free debt advice, or, in specific situations, consider debt \nwrite-offs. Our products are straightforward, and we ensure transparency in all documentation, \nconsistent with consumer duty requirements. The price cap guarantees customers, or their \nrepresentatives will not repay more than twice what was borrowed, and many repayment solutions \ninclude temporary payment freezes, or alternative solutions that fit their current financial \ncircumstances. We assist customers in managing their accounts by recording calls and making \ncomprehensive notes, ensuring agents are well-informed of the customer's history when handling their \naccounts. \nFor vulnerable customers who fall into arrears, we offer forbearance, develop sustainable repayment \nplans, and treat each case with sensitivity. We adapt collections activities to accommodate \nvulnerability, providing flexible repayment options and working closely with the customer to prevent \nundue hardship. \nIf a customer appears flustered, agitated, or emotional, we will aim to reschedule the discussion, \nadjusting our approach depending on whether they are making an application or addressing collections. \nWhere possible, we will record on our loan management system any information the customer tells us; \nhowever, where special category data is concerned, we will seek the consent of the customer and \nensure the requirements of the Data Protection Act /General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) are \nadhered to. We give customers the opportunity to make a personal declaration about their capabilities \nand communication needs which can be recorded on their notes. If agents gain information during a call \nthat may be relevant in future calls or transactions, they may say “Would you like me to make a note of \nthat on your file so that if we contact you again the agent you speak to will be aware of this?” \nThis includes transferring data into our Loan Management System where a Notice of Correction has been \nfiled with a Credit Reference Agency. Notices of Correction (NOC) can include factors that influence our \ndecision to lend and our consideration of vulnerability and can include, for example, references to debt \nmanagement plans, power of attorney, gambling “do not lend” requests, and mental health or capacity \nissues. Where a NOC is present, an agent will review and if we feel further explanation is necessary, we \nwill try and contact the customer. \nDealing with Third Parties \nSome vulnerable customers may need to conduct their transactions through an intermediary. We have a \nset process whereby an authorised third party has a password and is required to accurately answer \nsome security questions which will enable them to conduct the call on the customer’s behalf. \nStaff Training \nOur staff training includes periodic internal sessions focused on listening and identifying vulnerability, \nsupported by training modules. Records of all training are maintained. We continually update our \ntraining materials to reflect the latest research and best practices, ensuring that staff are well-equipped \nin responsible lending, including identifying vulnerable customers and offering appropriate support for \nfair outcomes. \nFurthermore, our Quality Assurance (QA) programs—covering call listening and monitoring of email \napply to customer engagements, with particular attention to identifying and addressing the needs of \nvulnerable customers. This assists in delivery of high-quality service while maintaining vigilance for \nsigns of vulnerability. \n• Regular refresher courses focusing on new research and best practices in handling vulnerability. \n\n \n9 | Pa ge  Vulnerable Customer Policy                            \n• Role-playing scenarios to help staff practice identifying and responding to signs of vulnerability. \n• Training on specific communication strategies, such as using simple language, active listening, \nand empathy. \nBRUCE Model \nWe use the BRUCE Model to help identify vulnerability when we are interacting with our customers: \n• Behaviour and talk: Is the customer acting out of character? Look for indicators of vulnerability \nthrough the customer’s behaviour and speech. \n• Remembering: Is the customer experiencing problems with their memory or repeatedly \nrequesting information? Is the customer confused when asked basic questions such as personal \ndetails? \n• Understanding: Is the customer showing they understand all of the information they are being \nprovided with? Are they able to replay that information to you in a coherent manner? This would \ninclude the customer showing they understand the potential consequences both of making or not \nmaking their decision. \n• Communicating: Can the customer communicate their thoughts and questions and are they \nultimately able to make an informed decision? \n• Evaluating: Can the customer weigh up the information options open to them to make an \ninformed decision? \nA negative response to one or more of these questions at any time during your interaction suggests that \nfurther clarification is required as the customer could be vulnerable. \nTEXAS Model \nWe use the TEXAS model to help structure our conversations where a customer has disclosed personal \ninformation indicating they need additional support. \n• T - Thank them: It may have been a big step for the customer to share their situation. It’s \nimportant to acknowledge this and put them at ease. \n• E - Explain: Any information will be captured and used to support them in identifying and \nrecommending a suitable product or service and may reduce the need for them to repeat \nthemselves in the future. \n• X - Explicit Consent: The customer must provide explicit consent and confirm they’re \ncomfortable for you to record and share any sensitive information about their circumstances. \n• A - Ask: Some additional questions, for example, do you require any additional time to make a \ndecision to proceed? Is there any additional support you would like? \n• S - Signpost: Any potential support required, e.g., are there any appropriate third-party support \ngroups or charities that may help the customer? \nCommunication Cycle \nWhen it comes to having a conversation with customers who may need additional support, we also \nincorporate the communication cycle into our calls. Below is the 4 stages and their definition: \n\n \n10 | Pa ge  Vulnerable Customer Policy                            \n \nThe communication cycle allows a two-way conversation so that the customer is fully involved and gives \nthem the opportunity to express their views. The communication cycle has a huge impact when it comes \nto vulnerable customers as it allows the customer into the conversation by asking further questions if \nneeded and ensures that we are listening to exactly what is being said so that we are fully informed. We \nare then able to use the acknowledge section to confirm our understanding and show the customer we \nhave listened. \nProduct and Service Design \nWe design our products and services with vulnerable customers in mind, ensuring simplicity, \ntransparency, and accessibility at every step of the customer journey. Our affordability assessments \nincorporate a disposable buffer income to account for unexpected life, allowing customers the flexibility \nto meet repayments without overextending their financial resources. We regularly review our \ncommunication strategies and product terms to ensure they remain clear and easy to understand, with \ntailored assistance available when needed. \nMonitoring and Ensuring Positive Outcomes \nWe monitor the effectiveness of our vulnerability support processes to ensure positive outcomes for our \ncustomers. This includes reviewing feedback, complaints, and customer journeys to assess the impact \nof our support solutions.  \nOngoing Monitoring Framework for Vulnerable Customer Outcomes \nTo align with updated FCA guidance, SLPL has implemented an ongoing monitoring framework to ensure \nthat vulnerable customers consistently experience fair and positive outcomes throughout their \ninteractions with us. This framework will include periodic assessments of support effectiveness, \nfocusing on whether the outcomes of our interactions meet SLPL’s commitment to fairness and align \nwith FCA expectations. \nBy reviewing the collective impact of our policies and practices, SLPL aims to identify areas for \nimprovement, ensuring that our support for vulnerable customers remains robust and responsive to \ntheir needs. This approach will facilitate continuous enhancement of our practices, reinforcing our \ndedication to treating vulnerable customers fairly. \nRegular Reviews and Audits \nTo ensure continuous improvement and compliance: \n• Regular audits of the processes and interactions with vulnerable customers to ensure \ncompliance and effectiveness. \n• Periodic reviews of customer interactions to identify any missed signs of vulnerability. \n\n \n11 | Pa ge  Vulnerable Customer Policy                            \n• Regular feedback sessions with staff to discuss challenges and share successful strategies for \nhandling vulnerable customers.",

Introduction to Credit Reference Agencies \n \nIntroduction \nCredit reference agencies (CRAs) play a critical role in the financial ecosystem, \nparticularly in the UK. These agencies are responsible for collecting and maintaining \ninformation on consumers' borrowing and repayment behaviors. This data is then used \nby lenders to assess the creditworthiness of individuals and businesses. Understanding \nthe function and importance of CRAs is essential for anyone working in the financial \nservices sector, especially those involved in lending, credit management, and financial \nadvising. \n \nThe Significance of Credit Reference Agencies \nCRAs serve as the backbone of the credit system by providing essential data that helps \nmitigate risks for lenders and enables consumers to build their credit profiles. They \ncollect information from various sources such as banks, credit card companies, utility \nproviders, and public records. This information is compiled into comprehensive credit \nreports that are used to evaluate credit applications and determine interest rates. \nThe three main CRAs in the UK are Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Each of these \nagencies has its unique methodologies and data sources, contributing to a robust and \nmultifaceted view of an individual's credit health. \n \nExperian \nExperian is one of the largest credit reference agencies globally, known for its extensive \ndata and analytical tools. In the UK, Experian collects and analyzes credit histories to \nassist businesses in making informed lending decisions. Their services include credit \nreporting, risk management, and identity verification, catering to both individual and \ncorporate clients. \n \nEquifax \nEquifax offers a wide range of services including consumer and business credit \ninformation, fraud detection, and identity verification. Equifax maintains an extensive \ndatabase of credit information that lenders use to evaluate loan applications. Their \nanalytical tools help businesses manage risk and detect fraud, ensuring the integrity of \nthe credit system. \n\n \nTransUnion \nTransUnion, formerly known as Callcredit, provides comprehensive credit reporting, \nfraud prevention, and risk management services. It is recognized for its innovative \nsolutions and extensive credit databases.
